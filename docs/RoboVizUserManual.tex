% Your system must have a user manual. Append this to your report (make
% it Appendix A) or bind it separately if it is big. If your system is
% interactive and has a good user interface with context dependent help
% then this can be just a cheat sheet. Discuss the level at which your
% user manual is to be pitched with your client. If your system is to be
% extended then you might want to include a technical API manual.

% TODO Add the user manual as appendix A
% TODO discuss the level at which the user manual is to be pitched
% TODO If the system is to be extended, add an API manual

This is the User manual
