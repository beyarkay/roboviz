 * The simulator runs one simulation, which may contain multiple trials.
 *
 * The Simulator wraps the ODE code, and should be used by other classes
 * that wish to run a simulation.
 *
 * Historically there were separate executables for Server, ServerViewer, and
 * FileViewer.  This involved a lot of duplicate code, so this class aims to
 * encapsulate all ODE code in one place.
